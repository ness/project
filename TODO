TODO
=====
- project_configuration - format=null - terminate each path/output with \0
- project_configuration - iter-keys - allow the interation over keys to handle dicts in scripts
- project_configuration - iter - make it more clear what will happen - show is for humans, iter for scripts
- cd to project_dir when running hooks

IDEAS
======

- bin/project_state 
    - where and how to save the states - state.yaml
    - get it from requirement.txt - special name for it
    - git repos finden oder konfigurieren
    - sub command record - will find git dirs in 2 layers
- Try very hard to use existing things.
    - Makefiles etc.
I need a configuration management facility -.-;

- The idea to query for it from the shell is good - interface first.
- Starting with own format

OPEN Questions
===============

- How to define commands for the project?
- Which are the common sets of commands for every project.
    - clean
    - build
    - test
    - index
- project_edit - should there be a hook? or depend on $EDITOR
    - bash completion for files - and project_edit should find the right editor for the file

DONE
=====

- bin/project_edit - opens your editor/ide etc.
